# Anki_Motive

This repository contains a collection of Anki cards based on the wordlist and verbalist from the [Motive book by Huber](https://www.hueber.de/motive). The translations for the cards have been generated using the [Gemini Developers API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACn9t67LJqjAKYXApjUuTmSGfgZxV&gclid=CjwKCAiA7Y28BhAnEiwAAdOJUDETG_Kl-n8VQr2lBU5o-JCoECVjz0PcwEiGU1RRw7qy-8Kb4iFPVBoC8gwQAvD_BwE). Please note that these translations have not been manually reviewed and may contain some inaccuracies.

If you come across any errors or would like to suggest improvements, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/ivadym/Anki_Motive/issues/new) on this repository, and I'll work on correcting them.
