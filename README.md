# Anki_Motive

This repository contains a collection of Anki cards based on the word list and verb list from the
[Motive book by Huber](https://www.hueber.de/motive).

Each card is tagged with the type of the word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) and the level or lesson in which it
appears, allowing for a structured way to review vocabulary and grammar within the context of the book.

The translations for the cards have been generated using the [Gemini Developers API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACn9t67LJqjAKYXApjUuTmSGfgZxV&gclid=CjwKCAiA7Y28BhAnEiwAAdOJUDETG_Kl-n8VQr2lBU5o-JCoECVjz0PcwEiGU1RRw7qy-8Kb4iFPVBoC8gwQAvD_BwE).
Please note that these translations have not been manually reviewed and may contain inaccuracies.

If you come across any errors or would like to suggest improvements, feel free to open an
[issue on this repository](https://github.com/ivadym/Anki_Motive/issues/new), and I will work on correcting
them.
